# Type Conversion
# 1. Implicit Type conversion / Automatic

x = 2           # integer
y = 3.5         # float

print(x+y)
output = 5.5    # float (it gives float data type by itself)

# 2. Explicit Type conversion (Type casting) / Mannual

a = '12'    # string
b = 3       # int
c = int(a)  # convert string into integer

print(b+c)
output = 15 # integer (converting the value of sting into int
            # which is in 'a' variable then added which gives same datatype output)
